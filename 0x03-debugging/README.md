# 0x03. C - Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (Defects or probelms that prevent correct operation) within computer program,software or system.
Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring a th application or system level, memory dumps, atend profiling.

*[main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

## task :page_with_curl:
* **0. 0-main.c**
*[0-main.c](./0-main.c): In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project.

* **1. 1-main.c**
*[1-main.c](./1-main.c): Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with '-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic' for this task.

* **2. 2-largest_number.c**
*[2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c): Fix the code in '2-largest_number.c' so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

 Line count will not be checked for this task.
 * **3. 3-print_remaining_days.c**
 *[3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c): Fix the 'print_remaining_days()' function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

    Line count will not be checked for this task.
    You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of 'month' will never be less than '1' or greater than '12') and valid days (i.e. the value of 'day' will never be less than '1' or greater than '31').
    You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
